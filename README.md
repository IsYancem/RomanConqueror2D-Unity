# RomanConqueror2D-Unity

This project is a classic 2D side-scrolling game set in the Roman era, featuring an agile Roman Gladiator as the main character.

## Game Idea
Roman Conquerer 2D is a challenging game where players guide a Roman Gladiator through various levels, battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. The game's goal is to reach 100 points, which triggers a dynamic change in the background and unlocks a victory chest upon successful completion.

## Game Proposal
The game delivers an exciting mix of action and strategy. Players must navigate the Gladiator through the game world, deftly moving, jumping, and earning points while dealing with enemies and impediments. Points are scored by defeating enemies and avoiding obstacles. Upon scoring 100 points, the game's background dynamically changes to reflect the Gladiator's increasing dominance, and a victory chest is unlocked, signaling the player's win.
